This repository contains the code implementations for the method proposed in the paper **"Uncertainty Quantification with Physics-Informed Generative Process Distributions for the Heat Equation"**. Specifically, it provides the examples and implementations of the UQ-PIGD method.

The data used for the Darcy flow equations comes from the **ETH Zurich Research Collection**: [ETHZ Research Collection - Darcy Flow Data](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/674074).
